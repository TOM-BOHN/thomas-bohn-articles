# The Realms of Projects Framework: Understanding What Kind of Work You're Really Being Asked to Do

Throughout my career building and leading Centers of Excellence, I've been asked the same question by overwhelmed team leaders: "How do I prioritize when everyone wants my team to help with everything?" They describe a familiar frustration—business partners bringing requests that range from "Can you answer this quick question?" to "Can you redesign our entire operating model?" All of these requests land in the same backlog, evaluated with the same prioritization criteria, and executed with the same project management approach.

The result is predictable chaos. The team treats a five-minute question the same as a six-month transformation program. They apply heavyweight project management processes to lightweight consulting requests. They say yes to work that doesn't fit their charter because they don't have language to explain why it's a poor fit. They burn out trying to be everything to everyone, while adding maximum value to no one.

Time and time again, I've used this framework to help teams understand a fundamental truth: not all work is the same, and treating different types of work with the same execution approach guarantees failure. The type of work determines everything—how you scope it, how you execute it, how you measure success, and most critically, whether it's even work your team should be doing.

## The Realms of Projects Framework

The **Realms of Projects Framework** is a diagnostic tool for understanding what type of work you're being asked to do and whether it fits your team's charter and capabilities. The framework organizes all possible work into three distinct **realms**—**Services and Success**, **Digital Transformation**, and **Strategy and Planning**—each containing specific **project types** that require fundamentally different execution approaches.

The framework emerged when I was building a Center of Excellence for analytics and business intelligence. We had a small but effective team, and every stakeholder wanted us to help them with their problems. But we quickly discovered that each type of problem required completely different execution motions. Answering a question in a help channel required a different approach than building an automation tool, which required a different approach than defining a product vision. We were drowning because we were treating all work the same.

We developed this framework to sort and understand our work. We mapped every request to a specific project type, and we color-coded each type based on how well it fit our charter. **Red indicated poor fit**—work we should reject or redirect. **Orange indicated work we typically wouldn't do**—possible but not our strength. **Yellow was our grey area**—work we could do but needed to be selective about. **Green, from light to bold, was our sweet spot**—work where we added maximum value and that aligned perfectly with our mission.

![The Realms of Projects Framework](images/the_realms_of_projects_framework/the_realms_of_projects_framework.png)

As shown in the diagram, the framework organizes work into three **Project Realms** (Services and Success, Digital Transformation, Strategy and Planning), nine **Project Types** (Delivery & Operations, Consulting & Coaching, Enablement & Success, Digital Solutions, Business Process Improvement, Architecture & Design, Product Management, Business Analysis & Advisory, Program & Project Management), and specific **Business Needs** that each project type addresses.

The framework helped our team in three critical ways:

1. **Understanding ourselves:** We gained clarity on what we were good at, what fit our charter, and where we added maximum value. We could articulate our identity—"We're a Center of Excellence focused on enablement, architecture, and strategic advisory, not a delivery and operations team."

2. **Understanding our work:** We could quickly categorize any request into a specific project type, which immediately told us what execution approach to use, what skills we needed, and how to estimate effort.

3. **Understanding our boundaries:** We had language to explain why certain work didn't fit. Instead of saying "We're too busy," we could say "That's a Delivery & Operations request, which doesn't align with our charter as an enablement-focused team. Let me connect you with the right team."

Today, I use this framework as my first diagnostic step when digesting any problem. When a business partner comes with a request, I ask myself: "What are they really asking for? Are they asking for help in one area, or are they bundling multiple project types into a single request?" I find that most complex requests are actually combinations of multiple project types—someone asking for a "dashboard" might actually be asking for architecture design, digital solution development, enablement materials, and ongoing operational support. Breaking the request apart using this framework is essential before I can even begin to understand the real customer problem and needs.

## The Three Project Realms

The framework organizes all work into three distinct realms, each representing a fundamentally different relationship between your team and the work you're doing.

### Services and Success: Helping People Do Their Work

**Services and Success** encompasses work where you're helping people accomplish their objectives through direct support, guidance, and enablement. You're not changing systems or defining strategy—you're helping people be successful with existing capabilities or building their capacity to do work themselves.

This realm includes three project types:

- **Delivery & Operations:** Executing repeatable processes and providing operational support
- **Consulting & Coaching:** Providing expertise and guidance to help others solve problems
- **Enablement & Success:** Building people's capacity to do work themselves

The defining characteristic of Services and Success work is that **the business need is about people being able to do something**. Someone needs help executing a process, solving a problem, or learning how to do something. Your role is to provide that help—either by doing it for them, coaching them through it, or teaching them how to do it themselves.

**Why this matters:** Services and Success work is often the most visible and appreciated by business partners because it directly helps them accomplish their immediate objectives. But it's also the most operationally intensive and hardest to scale. If your team is primarily doing Services and Success work, you need strong operational processes and clear boundaries, or you'll drown in support requests.

### Digital Transformation: Changing How Work Gets Done

**Digital Transformation** encompasses work where you're changing how work gets done through technology, process improvement, or architectural design. You're not just helping people with existing capabilities—you're building new capabilities or fundamentally changing existing ones.

This realm includes three project types:

- **Digital Solutions:** Building technology solutions that change how work is done
- **Business Process Improvement:** Redesigning processes to improve efficiency or effectiveness
- **Architecture & Design:** Defining how systems, data, and capabilities should be structured

The defining characteristic of Digital Transformation work is that **the business need is about changing the system**. Something about how work currently gets done isn't working, and you need to build or redesign capabilities to enable better outcomes. Your role is to be a change agent—building new solutions, improving processes, or designing better architectures.

**Why this matters:** Digital Transformation work is where you add the most lasting value because you're changing capabilities, not just helping with immediate needs. But it's also the most complex and requires the most diverse skills—technical expertise, process design, change management, and stakeholder alignment. If your team is doing Digital Transformation work, you need strong project management and cross-functional collaboration.

### Strategy and Planning: Deciding What to Do

**Strategy and Planning** encompasses work where you're helping the organization decide what to do, how to prioritize, and how to organize work. You're not executing or building—you're defining direction, making decisions, and ensuring work happens effectively.

This realm includes three project types:

- **Product Management:** Defining what should be built and why
- **Business Analysis & Advisory:** Providing strategic guidance and decision support
- **Program & Project Management:** Organizing and coordinating work to ensure it happens

The defining characteristic of Strategy and Planning work is that **the business need is about making decisions and organizing work**. The organization needs to decide what to build, how to prioritize, what approach to take, or how to coordinate complex initiatives. Your role is to be a strategic advisor and orchestrator—helping leaders make better decisions and ensuring work is organized effectively.

**Why this matters:** Strategy and Planning work is where you have the most influence on organizational direction and priorities. But it's also the most ambiguous and requires the most senior skills—strategic thinking, executive communication, stakeholder management, and organizational savvy. If your team is doing Strategy and Planning work, you need strong relationships with leadership and credibility as strategic advisors.

## The Nine Project Types: Understanding Execution Approaches

Within the three realms, the framework defines nine distinct project types. Each project type has a specific business need it addresses, requires a different execution approach, and demands different skills from your team.

### Services and Success Project Types

#### Delivery & Operations: Support and Outsourcing

**Delivery & Operations** work is about executing repeatable processes and providing operational support. The business need is: **"Support and Outsourcing—Do It For Me."** Business partners need something done repeatedly and reliably, and they want you to do it for them.

**Examples:**
- Operating an intake process for operational requests
- Executing standard operating procedures to onboard new users or conduct audits
- Providing help desk support and triaging questions
- Managing user provisioning and access requests
- Running scheduled reports and data refreshes

**Execution approach:** Delivery & Operations work requires operational excellence—standardized processes, clear service level agreements, efficient execution, and reliable support. You're judged on speed, quality, and reliability. The key is to make repeatable work as efficient as possible through automation, documentation, and process optimization.

**Skills required:** Process management, operational discipline, attention to detail, customer service, efficiency optimization.

**Strategic considerations:** Delivery & Operations work is essential but operationally intensive. If this is a core part of your charter, you need strong operational infrastructure and clear capacity management. If it's not your charter, you need clear boundaries to avoid becoming a support team by default. Many Centers of Excellence struggle because they accidentally take on operational support work that doesn't fit their mission.

#### Consulting & Coaching: Do It For Me, Do It With Me

**Consulting & Coaching** work is about providing expertise and guidance to help others solve problems. The business need spans two modes: **"Do It For Me"** (solve urgent problems) and **"Do It With Me"** (collaborate on solutions). Business partners need expertise they don't have, and they want you to provide guidance, solve problems with them, or advise on approaches.

**Examples:**
- Holding office hours where people can ask questions and get expert advice
- Problem-solving urgent issues escalated from the community
- Advising on best approaches for specific situations
- Answering questions in help channels and forums
- Collaborating with teams to solve complex problems
- Providing expert guidance on specific decisions or approaches

**Execution approach:** Consulting & Coaching work requires deep expertise and strong communication skills. You're providing judgment and guidance, not just executing processes. The key is to understand the context quickly, provide actionable advice, and help people solve their immediate problems. This is inherently 1-to-1 or small group work.

**Skills required:** Deep domain expertise, consultative skills, communication, pattern recognition, rapid problem diagnosis, collaborative problem-solving.

**Strategic considerations:** Consulting & Coaching work builds strong relationships and demonstrates your expertise, but it doesn't scale well because it's 1-to-1 or small group work. The strategic approach is to use consulting engagements to identify common patterns, then create enablement materials that address those patterns at scale. Many successful teams use office hours and help channels as sources of insight for what enablement content to create.

#### Enablement & Success: Do It Myself, Self-Service, 1-to-Many

**Enablement & Success** work is about building people's capacity to do work themselves through scalable resources and self-service capabilities. The business need is: **"Do It Myself, Self-Service—1-to-Many."** Business partners want to be able to solve problems and accomplish objectives without depending on your team for every request. They want self-service capabilities, learning resources, and tools that empower them to help themselves.

**Examples:**
- Developing training materials and learning resources
- Creating starter templates and tools that people can use independently
- Building recorded sessions and documentation that people can reference
- Developing self-service capabilities that reduce dependency on your team
- Creating quick reference guides and how-to resources
- Building communities of practice where people can help each other
- Developing knowledge articles and best practice guidance
- Conducting workshops or training sessions that scale to many people

**Execution approach:** Enablement & Success work requires understanding what people need to learn, how they learn best, and what barriers prevent them from being self-sufficient. The key is to create resources that are genuinely useful and accessible, not just documentation that checks a box. Good enablement reduces future demand on your team by empowering people to solve problems themselves.

**Skills required:** Instructional design, technical writing, empathy for learners, understanding of common problems, tool development, community building.

**Strategic considerations:** Enablement & Success work is one of the highest-leverage activities a Center of Excellence can do. Every hour invested in good enablement can save dozens or hundreds of hours of future consulting and support work. The challenge is that enablement requires upfront investment and the benefits aren't always immediately visible. Many teams under-invest in enablement because they're too busy responding to immediate requests—creating a vicious cycle where they never build the capacity to scale.

### Digital Transformation Project Types

#### Digital Solutions: Change the Tools I Work With

**Digital Solutions** work is about building technology solutions that change how work gets done. The business need is: **"Change the Tools I Work With."** Business partners need new capabilities, automation, or tools that don't currently exist. They want technology that makes their work easier, faster, or more effective.

**Examples:**
- Developing automation scripts and tools that eliminate manual work
- Building dashboards and applications that make information more accessible
- Creating workflow applications that streamline business processes
- Developing APIs and integrations that connect systems
- Building data extraction and transformation tools
- Creating custom applications that address specific business needs

**Execution approach:** Digital Solutions work requires software development skills and understanding of user needs. You're building technology products, which means you need to understand requirements, design solutions, develop and test code, and deploy to production. The key is to balance speed with quality—building solutions that solve real problems without over-engineering.

**Skills required:** Software development, API integration, automation, user experience design, testing, deployment, technical problem-solving.

**Strategic considerations:** Digital Solutions work is where many Centers of Excellence add significant value by building capabilities that don't exist elsewhere in the organization. But it's also where teams can get trapped building one-off solutions that become maintenance burdens. The strategic approach is to build reusable components and platforms that can be leveraged across multiple use cases, not just custom solutions for each request.

#### Business Process Improvement: Change the Process of How I Work

**Business Process Improvement** work is about redesigning processes to improve efficiency or effectiveness. The business need is: **"Change the Process of How I Work."** Business partners have processes that aren't working well—they're inefficient, error-prone, or don't support desired outcomes. They want processes redesigned to work better.

**Examples:**
- Developing new business processes for recurring activities
- Redesigning workflows to eliminate bottlenecks and inefficiencies
- Creating process documentation and standard operating procedures
- Implementing process improvements based on data and feedback
- Designing governance processes and approval workflows
- Optimizing handoffs and coordination between teams

**Execution approach:** Business Process Improvement work requires understanding current processes, identifying problems and opportunities, designing better approaches, and implementing change. The key is to involve the people who do the work—they understand the problems and constraints better than anyone. Good process improvement balances efficiency with flexibility and considers how people actually work, not just how they theoretically should work.

**Skills required:** Process analysis, workflow design, change management, stakeholder engagement, documentation, continuous improvement mindset.

**Strategic considerations:** Business Process Improvement work often has high impact because processes affect many people over long periods. But it's also challenging because it requires changing how people work, which creates resistance. The strategic approach is to involve stakeholders in the design, start with high-pain processes where people are motivated to change, and iterate based on feedback rather than trying to design perfect processes upfront.

#### Architecture & Design: Tell Me How to Build It

**Architecture & Design** work is about defining how systems, data, and capabilities should be structured. The business need is: **"Tell Me How to Build It."** Business partners need to build or change capabilities, but they need expertise on how to structure them well—what patterns to use, how to ensure scalability and maintainability, how to integrate with existing systems.

**Examples:**
- Developing data models and information architecture
- Designing security models and access control frameworks
- Creating technical standards and design patterns
- Providing architectural guidance on system design
- Analyzing technical approaches and providing recommendations
- Designing integration patterns and data flows
- Conducting capability analysis and technical assessments

**Execution approach:** Architecture & Design work requires deep technical expertise and the ability to think systematically about how components fit together. You're not building solutions yourself—you're defining how they should be built. The key is to balance ideal design with practical constraints, and to provide guidance that's specific enough to be useful but flexible enough to adapt to specific situations.

**Skills required:** Systems thinking, technical architecture, design patterns, security and data modeling, technical communication, ability to balance trade-offs.

**Strategic considerations:** Architecture & Design work is critical for ensuring that solutions are built well and can scale and evolve over time. But it's also easy for architecture work to become disconnected from implementation reality—creating beautiful designs that no one actually follows. The strategic approach is to stay connected to implementation, provide practical guidance, and iterate on architectural patterns based on what actually works in practice.

### Strategy and Planning Project Types

#### Product Management: Tell Me How to Do It

**Product Management** work is about defining what should be built and why. The business need is: **"Tell Me How to Do It."** Business partners or team members need to understand what to build, how to break down complex work, what features to prioritize, and how to think about user needs.

**Examples:**
- Defining features and user stories for projects
- Understanding typical components of deliverables and coaching teams on how to break down work
- Connecting with customers to understand user stories and personas
- Prioritizing features and capabilities based on value and feasibility
- Defining product roadmaps and release plans
- Creating acceptance criteria and definition of done

**Execution approach:** Product Management work requires understanding both user needs and technical feasibility. You're translating between business objectives and technical implementation, helping teams understand what to build and why. The key is to stay connected to both users and the team building the solution, continuously refining understanding based on feedback and learning.

**Skills required:** User research, requirements definition, prioritization, roadmap planning, stakeholder communication, ability to balance competing needs.

**Strategic considerations:** Product Management work is essential for ensuring that teams build the right things, not just build things right. But it's also challenging because it requires making difficult trade-off decisions and saying no to good ideas in favor of great ones. The strategic approach is to stay focused on outcomes and user value, not just features, and to embrace iterative learning rather than trying to define perfect requirements upfront.

#### Business Analysis & Advisory: Tell Me What I Need to Do

**Business Analysis & Advisory** work is about providing strategic guidance and decision support. The business need is: **"Tell Me What I Need to Do."** Leaders need help understanding problems, evaluating options, making strategic decisions, and defining direction. They want strategic advice from someone who understands both the business context and the technical possibilities.

**Examples:**
- Creating product visions and strategic roadmaps
- Conducting stakeholder surveys and voice of customer research
- Running steering committees and delivering solution demonstrations
- Deriving business value metrics and ROI analysis
- Creating executive presentations and vision documents
- Answering strategic questions to inform organizational direction
- Providing recommendations on strategic decisions

**Execution approach:** Business Analysis & Advisory work requires understanding business strategy, analyzing complex situations, and communicating insights clearly to executives. You're providing strategic counsel, not just technical advice. The key is to understand the business context deeply, consider multiple perspectives, and provide recommendations that are both strategically sound and practically achievable.

**Skills required:** Strategic thinking, business analysis, stakeholder research, executive communication, financial analysis, presentation skills, political savvy.

**Strategic considerations:** Business Analysis & Advisory work is where you have the most influence on organizational direction and build the strongest relationships with leadership. But it's also the most ambiguous work and requires the most senior skills. The strategic approach is to build credibility through delivering valuable insights, stay connected to both strategy and implementation reality, and position yourself as a trusted advisor rather than just an analyst.

#### Program & Project Management: Make Sure It Happens

**Program & Project Management** work is about organizing and coordinating work to ensure it happens effectively. The business need is: **"Make Sure It Happens."** The organization has complex work that needs to be coordinated, tracked, and delivered. They need someone to organize the work, manage dependencies, track progress, and ensure things get done.

**Examples:**
- Running agile ceremonies and sprint planning
- Planning work, assigning tasks, and tracking progress
- Managing dependencies and coordinating across teams
- Escalating issues and removing blockers
- Developing strategic planning documents and objectives
- Managing continuous improvement initiatives
- Coordinating complex programs with multiple workstreams

**Execution approach:** Program & Project Management work requires organizational skills, attention to detail, and the ability to coordinate across multiple stakeholders. You're not doing the work yourself—you're ensuring it gets done effectively. The key is to provide structure without creating bureaucracy, and to focus on enabling the team rather than just tracking status.

**Skills required:** Project management, agile methodologies, coordination, risk management, communication, stakeholder management, organizational skills.

**Strategic considerations:** Program & Project Management work is essential for complex initiatives that require coordination across multiple teams or workstreams. But it's also easy for project management to become overhead that slows teams down rather than enabling them. The strategic approach is to match the level of project management rigor to the complexity of the work—lightweight coordination for simple projects, structured program management for complex initiatives.

## Using the Framework: Four Diagnostic Questions

The framework's power lies in using it as a diagnostic tool for every request. Before you can understand what someone needs, you need to understand what type of work they're asking for:

**1. What realm does this belong to?** Services and Success (helping people), Digital Transformation (changing systems), or Strategy and Planning (deciding what to do)?

**2. What specific project type is this?** Match the request to one of the nine project types based on the business need they're expressing.

**3. Is this actually multiple project types bundled together?** This is the most critical question. A request for "a dashboard" often means: Architecture & Design (structure our data), Digital Solutions (build the tool), Enablement & Success (train our team), and Delivery & Operations (provide ongoing support). Business partners bundle these together because they don't have language to distinguish them. Your job is to unbundle the request and scope each component appropriately.

**4. Does this fit our charter and capabilities?** Use color-coding to evaluate fit. For our Center of Excellence: **Bold Green** (perfect fit—enablement, architecture, strategic advisory), **Light Green** (good fit—product management, process improvement), **Yellow** (possible but selective), **Orange** (poor fit—delivery and operations), **Red** (wrong team).

This language gives you a professional way to say no: "That's a Delivery & Operations request, which is orange for our team. We typically don't do that work because it doesn't fit our charter as an enablement-focused Center of Excellence. Let me connect you with the right team."

## Five Common Failure Patterns

After using this framework across many organizations, I've observed consistent patterns in how teams struggle:

**The Accidental Operations Team:** A Center of Excellence starts with a charter focused on enablement and strategy, but accumulates operational support work over time. Delivery & Operations work is visible, urgent, and appreciated—helping someone feels good. But each yes sets an expectation. Before they know it, they're spending 80% of their time on work that doesn't fit their charter, with no capacity for the strategic work that would actually scale their impact. **Solution:** Establish clear boundaries, invest in enablement to reduce operational demand, and redirect operational requests to appropriate teams.

**The Unbundled Request:** A business partner asks for "a dashboard." The team scopes it as a single project. Halfway through, they realize it's actually architecture design, solution development, enablement materials, and ongoing support—five different project types bundled together. They're massively under-scoped. **Solution:** Unbundle every request. Ask: "Let me make sure I understand everything you need. It sounds like you need architectural guidance, development, training, and ongoing support. Is that right?" Scope each component separately.

**The Wrong Execution Approach:** A team applies heavyweight project management to quick consulting requests, or treats strategic advisory work like a delivery project with fixed requirements. Lightweight work becomes bureaucratic and slow. Complex work lacks needed structure and fails. **Solution:** Match execution approach to project type. Consulting needs rapid response, not sprint planning. Digital Solutions needs proper development practices. Strategic advisory needs stakeholder engagement, not requirements documentation.

**The Missing Enablement Investment:** A team spends all their time answering questions and solving problems. They're constantly busy, always helpful, perpetually overwhelmed. They never create enablement materials because they're too busy answering the same questions repeatedly. They're creating dependency, not building capacity. **Solution:** Use consulting patterns to identify what enablement content to create. Protect capacity for enablement work. Measure success by how much you reduce future question volume, not by how many questions you answer.

**The Strategy Work That Never Happens:** A team is chartered for strategic work but drowns in execution work. Execution is concrete and urgent. Strategy is ambiguous and can always be deferred. Without deliberate protection, execution crowds out strategy every time. **Solution:** Treat strategic work as non-negotiable commitments. Establish regular strategic engagement patterns with leaders. Say no to execution work that prevents fulfilling strategic commitments.

## Putting It Into Practice

The framework isn't just for annual planning—it's a daily diagnostic tool. Use it three ways:

**When you receive a request:** Identify the project type(s). Assess fit against your charter. Determine the right execution approach. Set clear expectations about what you're delivering.

**When you're planning work:** Categorize your backlog by project type to reveal patterns. Assess portfolio balance—are you spending capacity aligned with your charter? Identify missing capabilities or work you need to redirect. Establish clear boundaries.

**When you're evaluating your team:** Assess charter alignment—have you drifted into misaligned work? Identify skill gaps. Evaluate capacity allocation—are you protecting time for high-leverage work like enablement and strategy? Measure the right things for each project type.

The framework's deeper purpose is to provide clarity and boundaries. Throughout my career, I've watched teams struggle because they lack this clarity. They say yes to everything because they don't have language to explain why something doesn't fit. They treat all work the same because they don't recognize that different work types require different approaches. They burn out trying to be everything to everyone.

The next time someone brings you a request, don't just ask "Can we do this?" Ask: "What type of work is this really? Does it fit our charter? Are they asking for one thing or multiple things bundled together? What execution approach does this require? Is this the best use of our limited capacity?"

That clarity is the difference between teams that add strategic value and teams that drown in misaligned work. That clarity is the difference between teams that thrive and teams that burn out. That clarity is what this framework provides.
