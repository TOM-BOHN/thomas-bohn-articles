# Plans Directory

This directory contains temporary working memory for projects and work items:
- Session summaries and planning documents
- Session reflections (working memory, not permanent docs)
- Temporary notes and context
- Project planning documents
- Action item tracking

**Important:** This directory is NOT committed to remote (see .gitignore). 

Content here is ephemeral and should be:
1. Used during active work sessions to maintain context
2. Integrated into permanent documentation (rules, templates, checklists, READMEs)
3. Deleted or archived once learnings are integrated

## Directory Structure

```
plans/
├── .gitkeep                           # This file (committed for directory structure)
├── README.md                          # Plans directory documentation (committed)
├── [date]-[work-item]-session.md      # Active session summaries
├── [work-item]-planning.md            # Planning documents
└── reflections/                       # Session reflections (working memory)
    └── [date]-[article-name].md       # Detailed session reflections
```

## The Memory Model

Think of this as "working memory" (RAM) that gets consolidated into "long-term memory" (the rules, templates, and checklists).

**Plans Directory (Working Memory):**
- Temporary context during active work
- Session summaries and reflections
- Action items being tracked
- Planning documents
- **NOT committed to remote**
- **Deleted after integration**

**Rules/Templates/Checklists (Long-Term Memory):**
- Permanent codified knowledge
- Source of truth for standards and processes
- **Committed to remote**
- **Referenced in future work**

## Lifecycle

1. **Create**: During session to track progress and capture learnings
2. **Use**: Maintain context across conversation breaks
3. **Integrate**: Update rules, templates, checklists with learnings
4. **Delete**: Remove after learnings are integrated (or archive if desired)

## Why Not Commit Reflections?

Reflections are **working documents** that should be **integrated into rules**, not stored as separate documentation:

- **Learnings** → Update rules with new requirements
- **Process improvements** → Update workflow documentation
- **Templates needed** → Create actual templates
- **Quality patterns** → Update quality standards
- **Action items** → Complete and integrate

The **rules are the source of truth**, not the reflections. Reflections are the mechanism for updating rules, not permanent documentation themselves.
