# LinkedIn Marketing Workflow - Complete Example

This document demonstrates the complete workflow for creating and posting a LinkedIn post using the marketing optimization strategies.

## Example: The Enabling Team Framework

### Step 1: Review the Marketing Post File

**File:** `marketing/posts/the_enabling_team_framework.md`

This file contains:
- Optimized LinkedIn post (main post)
- Self-comment template (with link)
- Medium publication details

### Step 2: Prepare Your Post

**Main Post (Copy this to LinkedIn):**

```
You've hired an enabling team to uplift capabilities across your organization. Six months later, they're drowning in ad-hoc requests, building one-off solutions, and everyone's frustrated. Sound familiar?

**The Enabling Team Framework: A Structured Approach to Capability Transformation**

A practical framework for how enabling teams should organize and deliver capability transformation work—moving from reactive support to strategic capability uplift.

Key insights:
• Enabling teams play two distinct roles: Advising (shaping direction) and Facilitating (enabling execution)
• Capability transformation follows a deliberate sequence: Policy → Standards → Methodology → Process → Architecture
• Three delivery modes (Strategizing, Developing, Facilitating) require fundamentally different execution approaches

The framework provides diagnostic tools to identify gaps, epic templates to organize work, and clear guidance on when to advise versus facilitate.

If you're leading an enabling team or platform team, this framework will help you escape the reactive support trap and deliver lasting capability transformation.

```

### Step 3: Optimal Posting Time

**Best times:**
- Tuesday: 8-10 AM or 12-1 PM
- Wednesday: 8-10 AM or 12-1 PM (best day)
- Thursday: 8-10 AM or 12-1 PM

**Your timezone:** Adjust based on where your audience is located

### Step 4: Post Execution

1. **Copy main post** to LinkedIn
2. **Click "Post"**
3. **Immediately** (within 30 seconds) post the self-comment with link
4. **Set timer** for 15 minutes to check for comments

### Step 5: First 60 Minutes - Active Engagement

**Check every 15-30 minutes:**
- Respond to every comment
- Ask follow-up questions
- Thank people for engaging
- Answer questions thoroughly

**Example responses:**

If someone comments: "This resonates! We're struggling with exactly this."
Your response: "What's been the biggest challenge for your team? Is it the volume of requests, or more about knowing which work to prioritize?"

If someone asks: "How do you define the boundary between Advising and Facilitating?"
Your response: "Great question! Advising is about shaping direction—helping teams understand what good looks like. Facilitating is about enabling execution—providing the tools and support to get there. The article has a detailed breakdown with examples. What's your experience been?"

### Step 6: Track Performance

**After 24 hours, check LinkedIn Analytics:**

**Metrics to record:**
- Impressions: _____ (goal: 2-5x follower count)
- Engagement rate: _____ (goal: 5-10%)
- Comments: _____ (goal: 10+)
- Shares: _____ (goal: 5+)
- Link clicks: _____ (goal: 2-5% of impressions)

**After 7 days, final check:**
- Total impressions: _____
- Total engagement rate: _____
- Total comments: _____
- Total shares: _____
- Total link clicks: _____

### Step 7: Learn and Optimize

**Questions to ask:**
- Which part of the post got quoted in comments?
- What questions did people ask?
- Which hashtags drove discovery?
- What time did engagement peak?
- How did this compare to previous posts?

**Optimize next post:**
- Use similar hook style if it worked
- Adjust hashtags based on performance
- Try different posting time if needed
- Refine insights based on what resonated

```

**Problems:**
- ❌ Generic opening (no hook)
- ❌ Link in main post (kills reach)
- ❌ Vague insights (not actionable)
- ❌ Too few hashtags
- ❌ No engagement strategy

**Expected performance:**
- Impressions: 0.5-1x follower count (link penalty)
- Engagement rate: 1-2%
- Comments: 0-2
- Link clicks: 0.5-1% of impressions

### After (Optimized Approach)

```

## Pro Tips

### 1. Visual Content Boost

**Add a visual to your post:**
- Use framework diagram: `images/the_enabling_team_framework/the_enabling_team_framework.png`
- Upload when creating post
- Visual content increases engagement 2-3x

### 2. Tag Strategically (Use Sparingly)

**When to tag:**
- If you're building on someone's work (credit them)
- If you're responding to a conversation (tag participants)
- If you're collaborating (tag co-authors)

**When NOT to tag:**
- Don't tag random influencers hoping for reach
- Don't tag more than 2-3 people
- Don't tag in every post

### 3. Content Series Strategy

**Week 1:** Post the framework overview (this post)
**Week 2:** Share a case study: "How one team used the Enabling Team Framework to escape reactive support"
**Week 3:** Deep dive: "The two roles of enabling teams: When to Advise vs Facilitate"
**Week 4:** Q&A: "Your questions about enabling teams answered"

Each post references others, building a content ecosystem.

### 4. Repurpose Comments

**If someone asks a great question:**
- Give thorough answer in comments
- Save that Q&A
- Create future post addressing it
- Credit the person who asked

### 5. Track What Works

**Create a simple spreadsheet:**

| Post Date | Topic | Hook Type | Impressions | Engagement % | Comments | Best Hashtag |
|-----------|-------|-----------|-------------|--------------|----------|--------------|
| 2025-01-07 | Enabling Teams | Problem scenario | 5,234 | 8.2% | 23 | #TeamTopologies |
| 2025-01-10 | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

**Look for patterns:**
- Which hook styles work best?
- Which topics resonate most?
- Which hashtags drive discovery?
- Which days/times perform best?

## Troubleshooting

### Low Impressions

**Possible causes:**
- Posted at wrong time (try Tue-Thu, 8-10 AM)
- Link in main post (move to comment)
- Hashtags too niche or too broad (mix popular + niche)
- Inconsistent posting (post 3-5x/week)

### Low Engagement

**Possible causes:**
- Weak hook (make it more specific and personal)
- Abstract insights (make them concrete and actionable)
- No call-to-action (invite discussion)
- Didn't engage in first 60 minutes (respond to every comment)

### Low Click-Through

**Possible causes:**
- Post doesn't create curiosity (tease insights, don't give everything away)
- Value proposition unclear (what will they learn?)
- Link hard to find (make self-comment immediately)
- Timing of self-comment (post within 30 seconds of main post)

## Success Story Template

**After 3 months of optimized posting:**

**Before:**
- Average impressions: 500 (0.5x followers)
- Average engagement: 2%
- Average comments: 1-2
- Posting: Inconsistent, whenever

**After:**
- Average impressions: 5,000 (5x followers)
- Average engagement: 8%
- Average comments: 15-20
- Posting: 3x/week, Tue/Wed/Thu 9 AM

**What changed:**
1. Link-in-comments strategy
2. Specific, personal hooks
3. Concrete, actionable insights
4. Strategic hashtag mix
5. Active engagement first 60 minutes
6. Consistent posting schedule

**Result:** 10x improvement in reach and engagement
