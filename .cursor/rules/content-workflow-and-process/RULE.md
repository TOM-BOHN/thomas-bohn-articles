# Content Workflow and Process

This rule defines the workflow and process for creating new content, editing existing articles, extending frameworks, and maintaining the repository.

## Creating New Content

Follow this 6-phase process when creating new articles or frameworks:

### Phase 1: Research (Before Writing)

**Purpose:** Understand the repository's voice, style, and standards before starting.

**Activities:**
1. Read at least 2-3 existing articles in full
2. Note patterns in structure, voice, and formatting
3. Identify the target audience and their pain points
4. Research any established frameworks you'll reference
5. Gather examples and scenarios from your experience

**Deliverable:** Mental model of the repository's style and clear understanding of the problem you're solving

**Time Investment:** 1-2 hours

**Questions to Answer:**
- What problem does this article solve?
- Who is the target reader?
- What frameworks or concepts will I reference?
- What examples can I use to illustrate key points?
- How does this fit with existing articles in the repository?

### Phase 2: Outline (Before Drafting)

**Purpose:** Create a detailed outline following article structure standards.

**Activities:**
1. Use the standard 8-part article structure as your template
2. Write topic sentences for each major section
3. List the key points to cover in each section
4. Identify where examples, diagrams, or case studies are needed
5. Note any gaps in your thinking or research

**Deliverable:** Detailed outline with topic sentences and key points

**Structure:**
```markdown
# [Article Title]

## 1. Opening Hook (2-4 paragraphs)
- [Pain point/question 1]
- [Pain point/question 2]
- [Personal credibility statement]
- [Pattern that led to framework]

## 2. Framework Introduction (2-3 paragraphs)
- [What the framework is]
- [Why it matters]
- [How it emerged from practice]

## 3. Core Framework Elements
### Element 1: [Name]
- [Definition]
- [Key points to cover]
- [Example needed]

[Continue for all elements]

## 4. Integration and Interaction
- [How elements work together]
- [Sequence and dependencies]
- [Common misconceptions]

[Continue through all 8 sections]
```

**Time Investment:** 30-60 minutes

**Quality Check:**
- Does the outline follow the standard structure?
- Are all framework elements clearly defined?
- Have I identified where examples are needed?
- Does the flow make logical sense?

### Phase 3: Draft (Focus on Content)

**Purpose:** Write the full draft, focusing on getting ideas down without worrying about perfection.

**Activities:**
1. Write from the outline, expanding each section
2. Focus on clarity and completeness, not polish
3. Include concrete examples and scenarios
4. Write in first-person where appropriate
5. Don't stop to edit—keep the writing flowing

**Deliverable:** Complete first draft with all sections

**Writing Tips:**
- Start with the section you're most excited about (doesn't have to be the beginning)
- Use placeholders for examples you'll develop later: [Example: CI/CD adoption failure]
- Write longer than needed—you'll cut in revision
- Include rough versions of diagrams or note where they're needed
- Don't worry about perfect word choice yet

**Time Investment:** 3-6 hours for a full framework article

**Quality Check:**
- Have I covered all required sections?
- Are my examples concrete enough?
- Have I explained the "why" behind each framework element?
- Does the article solve the problem I set out to solve?

### Phase 4: Revision (Focus on Clarity)

**Purpose:** Edit for clarity, consistency, and flow without over-editing.
