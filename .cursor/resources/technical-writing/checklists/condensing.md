# Condensing Content Checklist

Use this checklist when asked to reduce article length while maintaining quality and style.

## Before Starting

- [ ] Understand target word count or reduction percentage
- [ ] Read entire article to identify core thesis
- [ ] Note which sections are most/least important

## Condensing Strategy

- [ ] Identify less important sections (not just long sections)
- [ ] Remove entire ideas/explanations, not just trim sentences
- [ ] Focus on removing less important sections entirely rather than trimming everything equally
- [ ] Maintain paper's voice and style while cutting
- [ ] Preserve core thesis and key arguments

## What to Remove

- [ ] Less important sections or subsections
- [ ] Redundant explanations
- [ ] Examples that don't add new insight
- [ ] Tangential points
- [ ] Verbose transitions

## What to Keep

- [ ] Core thesis and main arguments
- [ ] Essential examples that illustrate key points
- [ ] Voice and style (first-person, specific language)
- [ ] Logical flow and connections
- [ ] Framework structure and definitions

## Quality Checks

- [ ] Core thesis still clear and emphasized?
- [ ] Voice and style maintained?
- [ ] Content still flows logically?
- [ ] Target word count or reduction achieved?
- [ ] No jarring gaps from removed content?

## Final Validation

- [ ] Read condensed version aloud to check rhythm
- [ ] Verify all essential points still present
- [ ] Check that examples still support arguments
- [ ] Ensure transitions still work after cuts
- [ ] Confirm article still delivers on opening promise

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- ❌ Trimming every sentence uniformly
- ❌ Removing only long sections
- ❌ Changing voice or style while condensing
- ❌ Creating gaps in logical flow
- ❌ Losing core thesis in the cuts
- ❌ Making content choppy or abrupt

## Key Principle

**Condensing is about scope reduction, not word efficiency.** Remove ideas and explanations while maintaining the paper's style and voice. Better to remove an entire less-important section than to trim every sentence.
