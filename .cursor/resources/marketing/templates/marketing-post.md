## Template Usage Notes

### LinkedIn Post Guidelines

**IMPORTANT: Link-in-Comments Strategy**
- **NEVER put the article link in the main post body** - it kills organic reach
- Always reference "See first comment for link" in the main post
- Post the link as a self-comment immediately after publishing
- This approach maximizes impressions while still providing access

**Post Structure:**
- **Opening hook**: Start with a relatable problem from your experience. Use "I" statements. First 2-3 lines determine if readers click "See More."
- **Framework title**: Use bold formatting. Include subtitle if it adds clarity.
- **One-line description**: Focus on what it enables or solves, not just what it is.
- **Key insights**: 3-4 bullet points, each should be specific and actionable. Use "•" not "-".
- **Result statement**: Quantify if possible (weeks to hours, 10x faster, etc.)
- **Personal note**: Make it authentic. Reference the creation process or your experience.
- **Call to action**: Invite engagement without being pushy.
- **Hashtags**: 5-6 relevant hashtags. Mix 2-3 popular tags with 2-3 niche tags.

**Optimization:**
- **Length**: 150-300 words ideal
- **Timing**: Post Tuesday-Thursday, 8-10 AM or 12-1 PM (your audience's timezone)
- **Engagement**: Respond to every comment in first 60 minutes
- **Visuals**: Include framework diagrams or infographics when possible (1200x627px optimal)

**For detailed optimization strategies, see:** `.cursor/rules/marketing/linkedin-optimization/RULE.md`
