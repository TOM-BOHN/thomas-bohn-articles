# LinkedIn Marketing Checklist

Use this checklist every time you create a LinkedIn post for maximum reach and engagement.

## Pre-Creation Phase

### Content Preparation
- [ ] Identify article or external content to share
- [ ] Review article for key insights and metrics
- [ ] Identify target audience (who will this help?)
- [ ] Note any visuals available (diagrams, charts)

### Research
- [ ] Check recent posts for what's working
- [ ] Review analytics from last 3 posts
- [ ] Identify optimal posting time for this week
- [ ] Research hashtags (mix popular + niche)

## Post Creation Phase

### Structure
- [ ] **Hook (2-3 sentences)**: Specific problem from personal experience
- [ ] **Title**: Bold formatting with value proposition
- [ ] **One-line description**: What it solves or enables
- [ ] **Key insights (3-4 bullets)**: Specific, actionable, standalone
- [ ] **Result statement**: Quantified impact if possible
- [ ] **Personal note**: Who this helps, authentic voice
- [ ] **Call-to-action**: "Read the full framework: [See first comment for link]"
- [ ] **Hashtags**: 5-6 strategic tags (2-3 popular, 2-3 niche)

### Quality Checks

**Hook Quality:**
- [ ] Uses "I" or "You" (not "Many companies" or "In today's world")
- [ ] States specific, relatable problem
- [ ] Creates curiosity or recognition
- [ ] First 2-3 lines work without "See More"

**Insights Quality:**
- [ ] Each insight is specific (names elements, numbers, sequences)
- [ ] Each insight is actionable (reader can apply it)
- [ ] Each insight stands alone (makes sense without article)
- [ ] No corporate jargon or abstract language
- [ ] Uses bullet points (•) not dashes (-)

**Overall Quality:**
- [ ] Length: 150-300 words
- [ ] Line breaks for scannability
- [ ] Conversational yet professional tone
- [ ] Provides value without clicking link
- [ ] No external link in main post body

### Algorithm Optimization
- [ ] **CRITICAL:** No link in main post body
- [ ] Says "See first comment for link"
- [ ] Self-comment prepared with link
- [ ] Visual content attached (if available)
- [ ] Hashtags researched (not just guessed)
- [ ] Posting during optimal time window

## Pre-Post Phase

### Final Review
- [ ] Read hook out loud (does it grab attention?)
- [ ] Verify title is bold
- [ ] Count insights (3-4 is optimal)
- [ ] Check for typos and grammar
- [ ] Verify no link in main post
- [ ] Confirm self-comment is ready

### Timing Check
- [ ] Posting on Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday
- [ ] Posting between 8-10 AM or 12-1 PM (audience timezone)
- [ ] Can engage actively for next 60 minutes
- [ ] Not posting on Monday morning or Friday afternoon

### Engagement Preparation
- [ ] Next 60 minutes blocked for engagement
- [ ] Notifications turned on
- [ ] Ready to respond to comments
- [ ] Have follow-up questions prepared

## Post Execution Phase

### Posting Sequence
1. [ ] Copy main post to LinkedIn
2. [ ] Attach visual (if available)
3. [ ] Click "Post"
4. [ ] **Immediately** (within 30 seconds) post self-comment with link
5. [ ] Set timer for 15 minutes

### First 60 Minutes (CRITICAL)

**Every 15-30 minutes:**

**Engagement Quality:**

## Quick Reference

### Good Hook Examples
✅ "You've hired an enabling team to uplift capabilities. Six months later, they're drowning in ad-hoc requests. Sound familiar?"
✅ "I had dozens of frameworks trapped in my head. But I couldn't get them documented fast enough."
✅ "'How do I prioritize when everyone wants my team to help?' Every leader I've worked with asks this."

### Good Insight Examples
✅ "Enabling teams play two distinct roles: Advising (shaping direction) and Facilitating (enabling execution)"
✅ "Specifications make quality repeatable—define what excellent looks like before you write"
✅ "Most 'simple' requests are actually 3-5 different project types bundled together"
