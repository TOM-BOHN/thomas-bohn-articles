# Starting with Artifacts: Types and Usage

This reference explains how to start with existing artifacts rather than a blank page when creating framework articles.

## Core Principle

**Don't write from scratch.** Start with fragments and shape them into comprehensive content.

Frameworks don't emerge from blank pages. They emerge from:
- Diagrams you've drawn
- Presentations you've given
- Rough notes from consulting
- Voice recordings explaining concepts
- Demos or workshops you've run

## Types of Artifacts

### 1. Framework Diagrams

**What it is:**
- Visual representation of framework structure
- Can be rough sketch or polished diagram
- Shows components and relationships

**How to use:**
- Start by creating or gathering the diagram
- Use it to ground the scope and structure
- Let it guide your outline
- A diagram is worth 1,000 words of starting content

**Example:**
> "I had drawn this diagram on a whiteboard dozens of times when explaining to teams how their work fits together. That diagram became the foundation for the article."

**Tools:**
- Whiteboard photos
- Mermaid diagrams
- PowerPoint/Keynote slides
- Hand-drawn sketches

### 2. Rough Drafts or Notes

**What it is:**
- Partial writeups from previous work
- Notes from consulting engagements
- Email explanations you've sent
- Documentation fragments

**How to use:**
- Gather all related notes
- Identify which parts are most developed
- Use as starting point for sections
- Fill gaps and add structure

**Example:**
> "I had a 3-page rough draft from a consulting engagement. It covered the core concepts but lacked examples and structure. I used it as the foundation and shaped it into the full article."

**Common sources:**
- Consulting deliverables
- Internal documentation
- Email threads explaining concepts
- Meeting notes

### 3. Presentations or Slides

**What it is:**
- Conference talks
- Internal presentations
- Workshop materials
- Demo decks

**How to use:**
- Each slide can become a section or paragraph
- Speaker notes contain detailed explanations
- Slide structure often maps to article structure
- Examples from presentation translate directly

**Example:**
> "I had given this presentation three times at different companies. The slide deck had the framework structure, and my speaker notes had all the explanations. I turned it into an article by expanding each slide into a section."

**What to extract:**
- Framework structure from slide titles
- Definitions from slide content
- Examples from case studies
- Diagrams from visuals

### 4. Voice Notes or Recordings

**What it is:**
- Voice memos explaining concepts
- Recorded explanations to colleagues
- Dictated ideas
- Audio from presentations

**How to use:**
- Transcribe (manually or with tools)
- Extract key explanations and examples
- Capture natural voice and phrasing
- Use as raw material for drafting

**Example:**
> "I recorded a 15-minute voice memo explaining the framework while driving. The transcription gave me rough content that I shaped into the article structure."

**Tools:**
- Voice memos app
- Cursor dictation
- Meeting recordings
- Transcription services

### 5. Demos or Workshops

**What it is:**
- Hands-on demonstrations
- Workshop exercises
- Training materials
- Interactive sessions

**How to use:**
- Document the process you walked through
- Capture questions people asked
- Record examples that resonated
- Use participant feedback to identify gaps

**Example:**
> "I ran a workshop where teams applied the framework to their own situations. The exercises became the 'Putting It Into Practice' section, and the questions they asked revealed what needed more explanation."

**What to capture:**
- Step-by-step process
- Common questions
- Effective examples
- Failure modes people encountered

### 6. Previous Whitepapers

**What it is:**
- Articles you've already written
- Related frameworks
- Similar content structure
- Established voice and style

**How to use:**
- Reference for structure and format
- Examples of voice and tone
- Templates for sections
- Patterns to follow

**Example:**
> "I used 'The Realms of Projects Framework' as reference for structure, voice, and marketing post format. It grounded my style and ensured consistency."

**What to extract:**
- Article structure patterns
- Voice and tone examples
- Section templates
- Format standards

## Workflow: Artifacts → Article

### Step 1: Gather All Artifacts

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Framework diagrams (any format)
- [ ] Rough drafts or notes
- [ ] Presentation slides
- [ ] Voice recordings or transcripts
- [ ] Workshop materials
- [ ] Related previous articles

### Step 2: Assess What You Have

**Questions:**
- What's most developed?
- What provides the best starting point?
- What gaps need to be filled?
- What examples already exist?

### Step 3: Choose Primary Artifact

**Priority order:**
1. Framework diagram (provides structure)
2. Presentation (has structure + content)
3. Rough draft (has content, needs structure)
4. Voice notes (has ideas, needs everything)

### Step 4: Build Outline from Artifacts

**Map artifacts to article structure:**
- Diagram → Framework elements section
- Presentation slides → Section headings
- Notes → Content for sections
- Examples from demos → Practical application

### Step 5: Fill Gaps

**What artifacts typically don't provide:**
- Opening hook (write fresh)
- Gap analysis examples (develop from experience)
- Measurement approach (add structure)
- Conclusion (write fresh)

### Step 6: Shape and Refine

**Transform artifacts into article:**
- Add structure (8-part format)
- Expand explanations
- Add examples
- Ensure voice consistency
- Polish and refine

## Examples in Practice

### Example 1: Diagram-First

**Starting artifact:** Whiteboard diagram of framework
**Process:**
1. Created clean Mermaid version of diagram
2. Each component became a section
3. Wrote definitions for each component
4. Added examples from memory
5. Structured into 8-part format

**Result:** Diagram provided the skeleton, writing filled it in

### Example 2: Presentation-First

**Starting artifact:** Conference presentation (20 slides)
**Process:**
1. Slide titles became section headings
2. Speaker notes became section content
3. Slide examples became article examples
4. Added opening hook and conclusion
5. Expanded thin sections

**Result:** 80% of content came from presentation

### Example 3: Voice Notes-First

**Starting artifact:** 15-minute voice recording
**Process:**
1. Transcribed recording
2. Extracted key concepts and structure
3. Organized into framework elements
4. Created diagram from description
5. Added examples and polish

**Result:** Voice captured ideas, structure came later

### Example 4: Multiple Artifacts

**Starting artifacts:** Diagram + rough draft + previous article for reference
**Process:**
1. Used diagram for structure
2. Used draft for core content
3. Used previous article for format and voice
4. Filled gaps with new content
5. Ensured consistency

**Result:** Combined artifacts provided 70% of final article

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Starting with Blank Page
**Problem:** Slow, lacks grounding
**Solution:** Always gather artifacts first

### Mistake 2: Ignoring Existing Materials
**Problem:** Recreating work you've already done
**Solution:** Search for anything related you've created

### Mistake 3: Expecting Perfect Artifacts
**Problem:** Waiting for polished starting point
**Solution:** Use rough materials, shape them later

### Mistake 4: Not Using Previous Articles
**Problem:** Inconsistent style and structure
**Solution:** Always reference previous whitepapers

## Key Principles

**1. Frameworks emerge from practice**
- You've likely explained this before
- Those explanations are artifacts
- Gather them before writing

**2. Artifacts ground scope**
- They define what you're covering
- They prevent scope creep
- They provide concrete starting point

**3. Shape, don't create from nothing**
- Transform existing materials
- Add structure and polish
- Fill gaps strategically

**4. Previous work teaches style**
- Use previous articles as reference
- Maintain consistency
- Build on established patterns

## Quick Start Guide

**Before writing anything:**

1. **Gather artifacts** (30-60 minutes)
   - Search for diagrams, notes, presentations
   - Find related previous articles
   - Collect voice notes or recordings

2. **Assess what you have** (15 minutes)
   - What's most complete?
   - What provides best structure?
   - What gaps exist?

3. **Choose primary artifact** (5 minutes)
   - Pick the one with most structure
   - Use others to fill gaps

4. **Build outline from artifacts** (30 minutes)
   - Map artifacts to 8-part structure
   - Note what needs to be created
   - Identify examples to develop

5. **Now start writing** (3-6 hours)
   - Fill in the outline
   - Shape artifacts into sections
   - Add missing pieces

**Result:** You're shaping existing materials, not starting from scratch.

## Remember

**You're not pulling whitepapers out of thin air.** You're taking frameworks that exist in fragments (diagrams, presentations, notes) and shaping them into comprehensive articles.

**The artifacts ground the work.** They define scope, provide structure, and give you a concrete starting point.

**Previous whitepapers teach the system.** They show voice, structure, and format. Use them as reference to maintain consistency.

**This is how frameworks actually emerge:** from practice, through artifacts, into comprehensive documentation.
