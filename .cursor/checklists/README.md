# Checklists

This directory contains milestone-based checklists for content creation, editing, and quality assurance.

## Organization Principle

**Checklists are organized by workflow milestones**, not by individual topics. This ensures you have one comprehensive checklist for each major phase of work.

## Available Checklists

### Content Creation
- **[content-creation-workflow-checklist.md](content-creation-workflow-checklist.md)** - Complete workflow for creating new articles
  - Phase 1: Before Starting
  - Phase 2: Before Drafting
  - Phase 4: Revision (Focus on Clarity)
  - Phase 5: Polish (Focus on Details)
  - Phase 6: Final Review (Read Aloud)

### Editing Existing Content
- **[editing-workflow-checklist.md](editing-workflow-checklist.md)** - Complete workflow for editing existing articles
  - Phase 1: Understand Intent
  - Phase 2: Identify Issues
  - Phase 3: Preserve Core
  - Phase 4: Enhance Selectively
  - Phase 5: Verify Consistency

### Framework Extension

  - Phase 2: Identify Gaps

  - Phase 5: Update Cross-References

### Quality Gates
- **[pre-publication-checklist.md](pre-publication-checklist.md)** - Final comprehensive check before publishing
  - Structure verification
  - Quality standards
  - Formatting checks
  - Technical requirements

- **[framework-quality-checklist.md](framework-quality-checklist.md)** - Framework-specific quality requirements
  - Origin story
  - Element definitions
  - Visual diagrams
  - Gap analysis
  - Measurement approach

### Development Process
- **[pre-commit-validation.md](pre-commit-validation.md)** - Validation checks before committing code

## How to Use

1. **During Work:** Use the workflow checklist for your current task (creation, editing, or extension)
2. **Before Publishing:** Use the pre-publication checklist as your final gate
3. **For Frameworks:** Also use the framework-quality-checklist
4. **Before Committing:** Use pre-commit-validation for technical checks

## Design Philosophy

**Milestone-based over topic-based:** Rather than having separate checklists for "quality," "formatting," "voice," etc., we organize by workflow milestones. This means:

- ✅ One checklist per major workflow
- ✅ All relevant checks grouped by phase
- ✅ Clear progression through the process
- ❌ No fragmented checklists covering similar topics
- ❌ No confusion about which checklist to use when

This approach ensures you always know which checklist to use based on what you're doing, not what aspect you're checking.
