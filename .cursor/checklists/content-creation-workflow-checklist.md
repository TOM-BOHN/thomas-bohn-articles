# Content Creation Workflow Checklist

Use this checklist as you progress through the 9-phase content creation process.

## Phase 1: Research (Before Writing)
- [ ] Read 2-3 existing articles for style and structure
- [ ] Understand target audience pain points
- [ ] Research established frameworks to reference
- [ ] Gather examples from experience
- [ ] Identify the problem to solve

**Time:** 1-2 hours

## Phase 2: Gather Artifacts (Before Drafting)
- [ ] Collect existing diagrams or sketches
- [ ] Gather rough drafts or notes
- [ ] Review presentation slides or demos
- [ ] Collect voice recordings if available
- [ ] Use previous whitepapers as reference

**Time:** 30-60 minutes

## Phase 3: Outline (Before Drafting)
- [ ] Use standard 8-part article structure
- [ ] Use `.cursor/templates/article-header-template.md` for opening
- [ ] Write topic sentences for each section
- [ ] List key points for each section
- [ ] Identify where examples/diagrams needed
- [ ] Note gaps in thinking

**Time:** 30-60 minutes

## Phase 4: Draft (Focus on Content)
- [ ] Write from outline, expanding each section
- [ ] Focus on clarity, not polish
- [ ] Include concrete examples
- [ ] Use first-person where appropriate
- [ ] Don't stop to edit—keep writing
- [ ] Cover all required sections

**Time:** 3-6 hours

## Phase 5: Revision (Focus on Clarity)
- [ ] Read entire draft without editing first
- [ ] Note unclear, redundant, or missing sections
- [ ] Simplify complex sentences
- [ ] Check terminology consistency
- [ ] Ensure examples are concrete
- [ ] Verify logical flow
- [ ] Cut unnecessary content
- [ ] Fix passive voice overuse
- [ ] Remove vague abstractions
- [ ] Strengthen transitions
- [ ] Define all acronyms

**Time:** 1-2 hours

## Phase 6: Condensing (If Needed)
- [ ] Identify less important sections (not just long ones)
- [ ] Remove entire ideas/explanations, not just words
- [ ] Maintain voice and style while cutting
- [ ] Verify core thesis still clear
- [ ] Read condensed version aloud
- [ ] Check rhythm and flow

**Time:** 30-60 minutes (if needed)

## Phase 7: Polish (Focus on Details)
- [ ] File named with lowercase and underscores
- [ ] Images stored in `images/article_name/` subdirectory
- [ ] Image paths use relative paths

- [ ] Lists use `-` for unordered, numbers for ordered
- [ ] Bold used for key terms on first introduction
- [ ] References section includes all cited sources
- [ ] All links work (no broken links)
- [ ] Parallel structure in lists

**Time:** 30-45 minutes

## Phase 8: Template Validation
- [ ] Marketing post matches `.cursor/templates/marketing-post-template.md`
- [ ] Article header matches `.cursor/templates/article-header-template.md`
- [ ] README updated with new article entry
- [ ] All templates followed exactly (structure, not just theme)
- [ ] File organization correct

**Time:** 10-15 minutes

## Phase 9: Final Review (Read Aloud)
- [ ] Read entire article aloud (or use text-to-speech)
- [ ] Voice is personal and experiential
- [ ] Tone is conversational yet professional
- [ ] Opening hook resonates with target audience
- [ ] Framework elements clearly explained
- [ ] Examples are concrete and realistic
- [ ] Gap analysis or practical application included
- [ ] Measurement approach defined
- [ ] Conclusion is actionable

- [ ] Delivers on opening promise

**Time:** 20-30 minutes
