# [Framework Title]: [Subtitle]

[Opening paragraph 1: State the problem from personal experience. Use first-person. Be specific about what you've developed or observed. Describe the frustration or bottleneck you faced.]

[Opening paragraph 2 (optional): Expand on the problem. Describe what you wanted to achieve but couldn't. Explain the limitations you faced.]

[Transition paragraph: The "What if?" moment. Start with "Then I asked myself..." or "What if I..." Describe the breakthrough question or insight that led to the framework.]

[Solution paragraph: Describe what you did, using literal language. Name specific tools and actions. Emphasize the practical implementation, not abstract concepts. If applicable, challenge conventional thinking or boundaries.]

## The [Framework Name]

The **[Framework Name]** is [one-sentence definition emphasizing what it is and what it does. Be specific about the problem it solves or the capability it enables].

[Origin paragraph: Explain how the framework emerged from personal frustration or practical problem. Use first-person narrative. Be specific about the context and challenge you faced.]

[Implementation paragraph: Describe how you actually use it. Name specific tools, practices, and workflows. Use literal language. If using software tools, name them explicitly (GitHub, Cursor, git, etc.).]

[Power/benefit paragraph: Explain what makes it effective. Describe the transformation it enabled. Quantify if possible (weeks to hours, 10x faster, etc.). Explain why it works.]

[Diagram explanation: Describe what the visual shows. Name the key components visible in the diagram. Explain how they relate to each other. Keep it brief but informative.]

## Template Usage Notes

### Opening Pattern
- **Problem statement**: Start with personal experience ("Throughout my career," "I've developed," "I faced")
- **Frustration**: Be specific about the bottleneck or challenge
- **Scale challenge**: Explain why existing approaches didn't work
- **"What if?" moment**: The breakthrough question that led to the solution
- **Solution approach**: What you actually did, using literal language
- **Result**: The transformation achieved

### Voice and Style
- Use first-person narrative
- Be specific (name tools, describe actions)
- Use literal language, not metaphorical
- Start with problem, not solution
- Include personal frustration or challenge
- Describe the breakthrough moment
- Emphasize practical implementation

### Framework Introduction Section
- **Definition**: One sentence, specific and clear
- **Origin**: How it emerged from practice (not theory)
- **Implementation**: How you actually use it (specific tools and practices)
- **Power**: What makes it effective (results and why it works)
- **Diagram**: Visual representation with brief explanation

### Table of Contents
- Include all major sections with anchor links
- Use consistent formatting (##, ###, etc.)
- Match exact heading text for anchor links
- Include subsections for major components

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- ❌ Starting with abstract theory
- ❌ Using metaphorical language when literal is more powerful
- ❌ Describing what "one might do" instead of what "I do"
- ❌ Vague problem statements
- ❌ Missing the "What if?" or breakthrough moment
- ❌ Not naming specific tools or practices
- ❌ Forgetting the Table of Contents

### Example: The Realms of Projects Framework

See `the_realms_of_projects_framework.md` for another example showing the pattern with a different framework type.
