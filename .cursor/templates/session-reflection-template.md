## Template Usage Guide

### When to Use This Template

**For every work session:**
- Use this template to maintain context and track progress
- Scale the detail level based on work complexity
- Always capture learnings and action items

**Lightweight usage (most sessions):**
- Fill in Summary, Progress, Action Items, Next Steps
- Add learnings only when they emerge
- Skip sections that don't apply

**Comprehensive usage (major work):**
- Fill in all sections thoroughly
- Document all learnings systematically
- Identify all improvements needed
- Use for framework articles, significant process improvements

### Location

Save in: `plans/[YYYY-MM-DD]-[work-item-name].md`

Examples:
- `plans/2025-12-27-enabling-team-revision.md`
- `plans/2025-12-28-data-governance-framework.md`
- `plans/2025-12-26-spec-driven-writing-framework.md`

### Lifecycle

**1. Create:**
- At start of session or when context needed
- Copy this template and fill in what you know

**2. Update:**
- Throughout session as you make progress
- When you receive feedback or discover learnings
- When new action items emerge
- Before pausing or ending session

**3. Integrate:**
- Work through action items
- Update rules, templates, checklists with learnings
- Ensure all insights are codified

**4. Delete:**
- After all learnings integrated into permanent docs
- After all action items complete
- When context no longer needed

### Key Principles

**1. Scale to the work:**
- Lightweight for simple tasks (Summary, Progress, Action Items)
- Comprehensive for major work (all sections filled thoroughly)
- Don't force detail where it doesn't add value

**2. Capture while fresh:**
- Add learnings as they emerge, don't wait until end
- Document feedback immediately when received
- Note action items when you identify them

**3. Be specific:**
- "Voice was good" → Not useful
- "Author prefers 'I use GitHub' over 'one might use GitHub'" → Specific and actionable

**4. Focus on integration:**
- The goal is to update rules, not accumulate reflections
- Every learning should lead to an action item
- After integration, delete this file

**5. Context for AI:**
- Critical for maintaining context across conversation breaks
- Include specific preferences or requirements stated
- Include key decisions made
- Include anything that would be expensive to re-explain

### Examples

#### Example 1: Lightweight Usage (Simple Revision)

```markdown
# Session Reflection: The Enabling Team Framework Revision
Date: 2025-12-27
Status: Completed

## Summary
Added measurement section to The Enabling Team Framework and condensed examples in Common Failure Modes section. Updated marketing post to reflect changes.

## Progress
- [x] Read existing article
- [x] Draft measurement section
- [x] Condense examples
- [x] Update marketing post
- [x] Run pre-commit checklist
- [x] Commit changes

## Voice and Style Learnings

### What We Learned
- Author prefers "team" over "squad" (more inclusive)

### Rules to Update
- [ ] Check consistency of "team" vs "squad" across other articles

## Action Items
- [ ] Check if "squad" appears in other articles and update for consistency

## Next Steps
Work complete. Delete this file after checking "squad" consistency.
```

#### Example 2: Comprehensive Usage (Major Framework Article)

```markdown
# Session Reflection: The Spec-Driven Writing Framework
Date: 2025-12-26
Status: Completed

## Summary
Created complete framework article from scratch documenting the agentic writing process. Applied spec-driven design and software engineering tools (GitHub, Cursor, git, AI agents) to technical writing. This was a meta-exercise: using the framework to document the framework itself. Session involved multiple iterations based on voice feedback, condensing content by ~25%, removing stylistic elements (em dashes, corporate jargon), and ensuring consistency with existing article templates. Final article: 5,685 words, includes Mermaid diagram, marketing post, and README entry.

## Progress
- [x] Created article outline
- [x] Drafted full article
- [x] Created Mermaid diagram
- [x] Generated PNG from diagram
- [x] Condensed content by 25%
- [x] Removed em dashes (38 instances)
- [x] Removed corporate jargon
- [x] Created marketing post
- [x] Updated README
- [x] Committed all files

## Voice and Style Learnings

### What We Learned
- **No em dashes (—)**: Author finds them jarring, replace with periods, commas, or parentheses
- **No corporate jargon**: Phrases like "diagnostic tools for organizational transformation" sound like "work-words"
- **Literal not metaphorical**: "I use GitHub" not "imagine using GitHub"
- **Personal narrative**: Start with frustration, "what if?" moment, solution
- **Condensing means removing ideas**: Not just shortening sentences

### Rules to Update
- [x] Update technical-writing-voice-and-style: Add prohibited practices (em dashes, corporate jargon)

## Process Improvements

### What Worked Well
- Starting with artifacts (diagrams, rough drafts) rather than blank page
- Using previous whitepapers as reference for style and structure
- Iterative condensing rather than trying to get length right first time

### What Needs Improvement
- No guidance on condensing content while maintaining style
- No template for marketing posts
- No checklist for pre-commit validation

### Rules to Update
- [ ] Update content-workflow-and-process: Add condensing guidance, artifacts step, template validation

## Templates and Checklists Needed
- [x] Create template: marketing-post-template.md
- [x] Create template: article-header-template.md
- [x] Create checklist: pre-commit-validation.md

## Specification Improvements

### New Requirements
- No em dashes anywhere in content
- No corporate jargon or "work-words"
- Marketing posts must follow template format exactly
- Table of Contents required at top of article

### Rules to Update
- [ ] Update article-structure-and-quality: Add TOC requirement
- [ ] Update framework-development-standards: Add literal vs metaphorical guidance

## Tool and Workflow Learnings
- Mermaid CLI: `mmdc -i input.mmd -o output.png -b transparent`
- PowerShell uses semicolon (;) for command chaining, not &&
- Marketing posts go in `marketing/posts/` with both LinkedIn and Medium sections

## Quality Patterns

### Issues Found
- Em dashes created jarring rhythm when read aloud
- Corporate jargon made writing sound generic, not personal
- First drafts tend to be ~25% too long

### Prevention Strategies
- Add "no em dashes" to linting checks
- Read aloud to catch rhythm problems
- Plan for condensing phase after drafting

## Action Items
- [x] Update technical-writing-voice-and-style: Add prohibited practices
- [x] Create marketing-post-template.md
- [x] Create article-header-template.md
- [x] Create pre-commit-validation.md
- [ ] Update content-workflow-and-process: Add condensing, artifacts, templates
- [ ] Update article-structure-and-quality: Add TOC requirement
- [ ] Create reference: plain-language-alternatives.md

## Next Steps
1. Work through remaining action items
2. Test improvements on next article
3. Delete this file after all learnings integrated
```

- Progress
- Action Items
- Next Steps

**Standard (most work):**
- Summary
- Progress
- Voice and Style (if feedback received)
- Process Improvements (if discovered)
- Action Items

### Integration Checklist

Before deleting this reflection:
- [ ] All action items completed or tracked elsewhere
- [ ] Voice learnings integrated into technical-writing-voice-and-style rule
- [ ] Process improvements integrated into content-workflow-and-process rule
- [ ] Templates created as needed
- [ ] Checklists created as needed
- [ ] Specification improvements integrated into relevant rules
- [ ] Quality patterns integrated into article-structure-and-quality rule

Once all learnings are integrated into rules/templates/checklists, delete this file. The learnings persist in the rules, not in the reflection.
