## Articles

### [The Spec-Driven Writing Framework](whitepapers/the_spec_driven_writing_framework.md)
*~5,700 words | 25 min read*

An approach to creating technical content by treating writing as software engineering. Not metaphorically, but literally. This framework applies specification-driven design, version control, automated validation, and agentic development to technical writing. It emerged from a personal challenge: frameworks existed in fragments (diagrams, drafts, presentations, voice notes) but couldn't be turned into comprehensive whitepapers fast enough.

**Key Topics:**
- Treating whitepapers as code: GitHub for version control, Cursor for diff reviews, git for change management
- Starting with artifacts (diagrams, drafts, presentations) and shaping them with AI agents
- Machine-readable specifications in `.cursor/rules/` that guide both humans and agents
- Four core components: Specification, Development, Validation, Iteration
- Previous whitepapers as reference library that compounds quality over time
- Automated validation against objective standards, not subjective judgment
- Result: weeks per article to hours while maintaining quality
- Proving that technical writing IS software engineering when you apply the same discipline and tools

### [The Enabling Team Framework](whitepapers/the_enabling_team_framework.md)
*~4,500 words | 20 min read*

A structured approach for how enabling teams should think about, organize, and deliver capability transformation work across an organization. This framework provides the practical "how" for enabling teams—breaking down complex capability uplift into clear roles, sequential elements, delivery modes, and work types.

**Key Topics:**
- Advising and Facilitating roles
- Sequential framework elements (Policy → Standards → Methodology → Process → Architecture)
- Three delivery modes: Strategizing, Developing, Facilitating
- Gap analysis and diagnostic patterns
- Work management through epic templates

### [The Four Cs of Data Governance Measurement](whitepapers/the_four_cs_of_data_governance_measurement.md)
*~3,800 words | 17 min read*

A comprehensive framework for measuring data governance maturity and cultural change across organizations. This article introduces the Four Cs—Compliance, Competency, Culture, and Capability—as a holistic approach to tracking data governance transformation.

**Key Topics:**
- The Four Cs measurement framework
- Data governance maturity assessment
- Cultural change indicators
- Measuring progress and adoption
- Building data-driven organizations

### [The Digital Transformation Framework](whitepapers/the_digital_transformation_framework.md)
*~5,200 words | 23 min read*

A diagnostic tool for understanding business partner maturity and building strategic partnerships in analytics work. This framework helps analytics teams escape the "delivery danger zone" by recognizing three distinct levels of partnership—Transformation, Innovation, and Delivery—and positioning themselves as trusted advisors rather than replaceable order-takers.

**Key Topics:**
- Three levels of business partner maturity
- Understanding needs vs. surface requests
- Building strategic partnerships vs. transactional relationships
- The maturity paradox: mature partners seek deep partnership
- Five common failure modes and how to avoid them
- Portfolio diagnostics and value-add assessment

### [The Realms of Projects Framework](whitepapers/the_realms_of_projects_framework.md)
*~6,000 words | 27 min read*

A diagnostic tool for understanding what type of work you're being asked to do and whether it fits your team's charter and capabilities. This framework helps Centers of Excellence and specialized teams categorize work into three realms and nine project types, each requiring fundamentally different execution approaches. It provides clarity on boundaries, helps teams say no professionally, and prevents burnout from misaligned work.

**Key Topics:**
- Three project realms: Services and Success, Digital Transformation, Strategy and Planning
- Nine distinct project types with specific business needs and execution approaches
- Color-coded fit assessment (red/orange/yellow/green)
- Diagnostic questions for unbundling complex requests
- Five common failure patterns teams encounter
- Daily usage for receiving requests, planning work, and evaluating teams

## About

These articles emerge from real-world experience leading organizational transformation initiatives, building enabling teams, and implementing sustainable change in software engineering organizations. The frameworks presented here serve as both diagnostic tools for advising leaders and practical checklists for executing transformation work.

## About the Author

Thomas Bohn is a software engineering leader with extensive experience in organizational transformation, data governance, and building high-performing teams. These frameworks represent years of practical application in real-world environments, refined through repeated use and validated by results.

## Using These Frameworks

These frameworks are designed to be:
- **Diagnostic**: Identify gaps and failure patterns in your organization
- **Practical**: Provide clear next steps and actionable guidance
- **Adaptable**: Apply to various contexts and organizational sizes
- **Proven**: Based on real-world experience, not academic theory

## Development Process

These articles were created using a spec-driven writing approach that treats technical content as software engineering. The methodology uses version control, AI assistance, machine-readable specifications, and automated validation to ensure quality and consistency.

**Interested in the process?** See [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) for complete details on the spec-driven writing system, including:
- How the system works
- Tools and workflows
- Quality standards
- How to adapt this approach for your own projects
