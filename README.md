### [The Enabling Team Framework](the_enabling_team_framework.md)

A structured approach for how enabling teams should think about, organize, and deliver capability transformation work across an organization. This framework provides the practical "how" for enabling teams—breaking down complex capability uplift into clear roles, sequential elements, delivery modes, and work types.

**Key Topics:**
- Advising and Facilitating roles
- Sequential framework elements (Policy → Standards → Methodology → Process → Architecture)
- Three delivery modes: Strategizing, Developing, Facilitating
- Gap analysis and diagnostic patterns
- Work management through epic templates

### [The Four Cs of Data Governance Measurement](the_four_cs_of_data_governance_measurement.md)

A comprehensive framework for measuring data governance maturity and cultural change across organizations. This article introduces the Four Cs—Compliance, Competency, Culture, and Capability—as a holistic approach to tracking data governance transformation.

**Key Topics:**
- The Four Cs measurement framework
- Data governance maturity assessment
- Cultural change indicators
- Measuring progress and adoption
- Building data-driven organizations

### [The Digital Transformation Framework](the_digital_transformation_framework.md)

A diagnostic tool for understanding business partner maturity and building strategic partnerships in analytics work. This framework helps analytics teams escape the "delivery danger zone" by recognizing three distinct levels of partnership—Transformation, Innovation, and Delivery—and positioning themselves as trusted advisors rather than replaceable order-takers.

**Key Topics:**
- Three levels of business partner maturity
- Understanding needs vs. surface requests
- Building strategic partnerships vs. transactional relationships
- The maturity paradox: mature partners seek deep partnership
- Five common failure modes and how to avoid them
- Portfolio diagnostics and value-add assessment

### [The Realms of Projects Framework](the_realms_of_projects_framework.md)

A diagnostic tool for understanding what type of work you're being asked to do and whether it fits your team's charter and capabilities. This framework helps Centers of Excellence and specialized teams categorize work into three realms and nine project types, each requiring fundamentally different execution approaches. It provides clarity on boundaries, helps teams say no professionally, and prevents burnout from misaligned work.

**Key Topics:**
- Three project realms: Services and Success, Digital Transformation, Strategy and Planning
- Nine distinct project types with specific business needs and execution approaches
- Color-coded fit assessment (red/orange/yellow/green)
- Diagnostic questions for unbundling complex requests
- Five common failure patterns teams encounter
- Daily usage for receiving requests, planning work, and evaluating teams
