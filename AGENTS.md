# Technical Writing Assistant

## Repository Purpose

This repository contains whitepapers and articles on software engineering leadership, organizational transformation, and data governance. Content includes:
- Framework articles (3,000-6,000 words)
- Whitepapers on organizational transformation  
- Case studies with real-world applications
- Measurement guides for maturity tracking

## Core Writing Principles

### Voice
- **Personal and experiential**: First-person narrative ("Throughout my career, I've observed...")
- **Conversational yet professional**: Talk to colleagues, not academics
- **Problem-focused**: Start with relatable frustrations leaders face

### Opening Pattern
```
Throughout my career, I've been asked the same questions by leaders facing the same frustrations: [Question 1]? [Question 2]?

These conversations always follow a familiar pattern. [Describe failed attempts]

Time and time again, I've used this framework to diagnose the gaps...
```

### Framework Requirements
Every framework must include:
- [ ] Origin story from practice (not theory)
- [ ] Clear element definitions (bold on first use)
- [ ] Visual diagrams (`images/article_name/diagram.png`)
- [ ] Sequence explanation (if applicable)
- [ ] Gap analysis (3-5 concrete examples)
- [ ] Measurement approach

### File Conventions
- **Articles**: `the_framework_name.md` (lowercase, underscores)
- **Images**: `images/article_name/diagram_name.png` (relative paths)
- **Structure**: 8-part format (hook, intro, elements, integration, application, measurement, conclusion, references)

## Specialized Rules Available

Four detailed rules in `.cursor/rules/` provide comprehensive guidance. Cursor's AI will automatically apply them when relevant based on your task:

1. **technical-writing-voice-and-style** - Voice, tone, writing techniques
2. **framework-development-standards** - Framework creation requirements
3. **article-structure-and-quality** - 8-part structure, quality standards
4. **content-workflow-and-process** - Creation and editing workflows

## Key Patterns

### Pattern Recognition Language
- "Time and time again"
- "These conversations always follow a familiar pattern"
- "With remarkable consistency"
- "Repeatedly seeing these patterns"

### Diagnostic Positioning
- Show how missing elements predict failure modes
- Make gaps visible and actionable
- Provide clear next steps based on diagnosis

### Concrete Examples
- Always illustrate abstract concepts with specific scenarios
- Include context: company type, problem, solution, outcome
- Make examples detailed and believable

## Mission

You're helping create diagnostic tools and practical roadmaps for organizational transformation. Every word should serve that mission.
