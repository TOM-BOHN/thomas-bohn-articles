# The Digital Transformation Framework - Marketing Content

## LinkedIn Post

Your analytics team built exactly what the business asked for. Six months later, nobody's using it. The business partner is disappointed, and your team is wondering what went wrong.

**The Digital Transformation Framework: Understanding What Your Business Partners Really Need**

A diagnostic tool for analytics teams to escape the "delivery danger zone" by understanding business partner maturity and building strategic partnerships instead of transactional relationships.

Key insights:
• The less your business partner knows what they need, the more value you can add—if you dig deeper
• Mature business partners actively seek transformation and innovation work, not just delivery
• Taking surface requests at face value guarantees you'll build the wrong thing

The framework distinguishes three levels of partnership—Transformation, Innovation, and Delivery—and shows how to position yourself as a trusted advisor rather than a replaceable order-taker.

If you're leading an analytics or data team and want to build strategic relationships that make you irreplaceable, this framework will change how you engage with business partners.
