# The Four Cs of Data Governance Measurement - Marketing Content

## LinkedIn Post

"How do we know if our data governance program is actually working?" I've been asked this question by every data leader I've advised. They've invested in tools, hired people, created policies—but they can't tell if they're making progress.

**The Four Cs of Data Governance Measurement**

A comprehensive framework for measuring data governance maturity and cultural change across organizations using Compliance, Competency, Culture, and Capability.

Key insights:
• Measuring only compliance misses 75% of what makes data governance successful
• Cultural change indicators reveal whether governance is becoming embedded or remains a checkbox exercise
• Capability maturity shows whether your organization can sustain governance long-term

The framework provides specific metrics for each dimension, guidance on data collection, and approaches to tracking transformation progress over time.

If you're leading data governance transformation and need to demonstrate value beyond compliance metrics, this framework will help you measure what actually matters.
