# The Enabling Team Framework - Marketing Content

## LinkedIn Post

Throughout my career, I've been asked the same questions by leaders facing the same frustrations: How do we develop a process-led culture? How do we mature our software engineering best practices? Why do our efforts to adopt new practices keep failing?

These conversations always follow a familiar pattern. The organization has tried before. They've invested in tools, run training sessions, launched initiatives. But nothing stuck. Sound familiar?

**The Enabling Team Framework: A Structured Approach to Capability Transformation**

A systematic way to break down the complex work of capability uplift into clear roles, sequential elements, and delivery modes that actually stick.

Key insights:
• Enabling teams operate in three distinct roles: Advising (defining the "what" and "why"), Developing (building the toolkit), and Facilitating (guiding adoption)
• Capability transformation follows a deliberate sequence: Policy → Standards → Methodology → Process → Architecture, then Operations → Data → Tools → Enablement → Support → Governance
• Missing pieces are diagnostic: no policy means teams won't understand why it matters, no operations means tools won't address real friction points, no enablement means teams struggle to build competency
• Five epic types organize the work: Business Case Development, Capability Development, Pilot/Incubation, Facilitation, and Implementation

The framework emerged from repeatedly diagnosing the same gaps: teams building sophisticated tooling without establishing clear policy, attempting to govern processes that were never properly defined, or not knowing which operational team will actually implement the process being transformed.

If you're leading an enabling team or platform team, this framework will help you escape the reactive support trap and deliver lasting capability transformation.

Thoughts on this approach? Curious to hear how others are structuring their enabling teams.

**Description for Medium:**
A comprehensive framework for how enabling teams should think about, organize, and deliver capability transformation work across an organization. Based on real-world experience diagnosing why capability adoption fails, this framework breaks down complex capability uplift into three distinct roles (Advising, Developing, and Facilitating), sequential elements (Policy through Governance), and three delivery modes (Strategizing, Developing, Facilitating). Learn why you need all pieces at some level of definition to get new solutions to stick: skip the policy and teams won't understand why it matters, skip operationalizing the process and tools won't address real friction points, skip enablement and teams struggle to build competency. Includes diagnostic gap analysis, five epic templates for organizing work, and practical guidance on identifying which operational teams will implement the processes you're transforming.
