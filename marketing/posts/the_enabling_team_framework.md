## LinkedIn Post

You've hired an enabling team to uplift capabilities across your organization. Six months later, they're drowning in ad-hoc requests, building one-off solutions, and everyone's frustrated. Sound familiar?

**The Enabling Team Framework: A Structured Approach to Capability Transformation**

A practical framework for how enabling teams should organize and deliver capability transformation work—moving from reactive support to strategic capability uplift.

Key insights:
• Enabling teams play two distinct roles: Advising (shaping direction) and Facilitating (enabling execution)
• Capability transformation follows a deliberate sequence: Policy → Standards → Methodology → Process → Architecture
• Three delivery modes (Strategizing, Developing, Facilitating) require fundamentally different execution approaches

The framework provides diagnostic tools to identify gaps, epic templates to organize work, and clear guidance on when to advise versus facilitate.

If you're leading an enabling team or platform team, this framework will help you escape the reactive support trap and deliver lasting capability transformation.
