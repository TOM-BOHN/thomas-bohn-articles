# The Realms of Projects Framework - Marketing Content

## LinkedIn Post

"How do I prioritize when everyone wants my team to help with everything?" Every Center of Excellence leader I've worked with asks this question. Their team is drowning—treating a five-minute question the same as a six-month transformation program.

**The Realms of Projects Framework: Understanding What Kind of Work You're Really Being Asked to Do**

A diagnostic tool for Centers of Excellence and specialized teams to categorize work, establish boundaries, and avoid burnout from misaligned work.

Key insights:
• Most "simple" requests are actually 3-5 different project types bundled together—unbundling them is critical
• Different project types require fundamentally different execution approaches—using the same approach for all work guarantees failure
• Color-coding work by fit (red/orange/yellow/green) gives you professional language to say no

The framework organizes all work into 3 realms and 9 project types, each with specific business needs and execution approaches. It helps teams understand what they're good at, what fits their charter, and where to draw boundaries.

If you're leading a Center of Excellence, platform team, or specialized team that's overwhelmed by diverse requests, this framework will help you gain clarity and protect capacity for high-value work.
