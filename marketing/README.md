### Creating New Marketing Content

When you write a new article:

2. Use the templates to structure your content
3. Follow the guidelines for hooks, descriptions, and calls to action
4. Choose relevant hashtags and tags
5. Ensure the featured image path is correct

## Guidelines

**LinkedIn Posts:**
- Start with a relatable problem or question
- Keep it scannable with bullet points
- Include 3 key insights that provide immediate value
- End with a clear call to action
- Use 3-5 relevant hashtags

**Medium Publications:**
- Choose a compelling subtitle that expands on the title
- Select 5 tags that balance broad appeal with niche specificity
- Use high-quality featured images (1400 x 788 pixels recommended)
- Include a description that highlights the framework's value and your experience

## Best Practices

1. **Timing:** Share articles during business hours (Tuesday-Thursday, 8-10 AM or 12-1 PM in your target timezone)
2. **Engagement:** Respond to comments within the first few hours to boost visibility
3. **Cross-promotion:** Share on multiple platforms but customize the message for each
4. **Follow-up:** Consider creating follow-up posts highlighting specific insights from the article
5. **Analytics:** Track which hooks and formats generate the most engagement

## Voice and Tone

All marketing content should maintain the same voice as the articles:
- Personal and experiential
- Conversational yet professional
- Problem-focused and practical
- Grounded in real-world experience
- Avoid corporate jargon and buzzwords
