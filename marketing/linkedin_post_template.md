**Hook:** Start with a relatable problem or question that your audience faces. Make them think "Yes, that's my problem!"

**Description:** Focus on the outcome or transformation the framework enables, not just what it is.

**Key Insights:** Choose 3 specific, actionable insights that demonstrate immediate value. These should be concrete enough to be useful even without reading the article.

**Call to Action:** Invite engagement - ask a question, invite comments, or encourage sharing.

**Hashtags:** Use 3-5 relevant hashtags. Mix popular tags with niche ones.

**Tone:** Professional but conversational. Personal and experiential. Avoid corporate jargon.
